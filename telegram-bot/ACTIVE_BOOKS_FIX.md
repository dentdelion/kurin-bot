# Active Books Functionality Fix

## Issue Description
The "My Books" functionality was not working correctly - when users had books that were:
- Yet to be delivered
- Already delivered but not picked up
- Already picked up and active

The system would show nothing or incomplete information.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Cache Dependency**: The system heavily relied on Redis cache for book status, but when cache failed, it would return empty results instead of falling back to Google Sheets.

2. **Limited Book State Handling**: The `get_user_pending_pickup_books` method only showed books with 'delivered' status, missing books that were booked but still being processed.

3. **Poor Status Fallback**: The `get_book_status` method in `BookManager` would return empty string when cache failed, instead of querying Google Sheets directly.

4. **Incomplete Display Logic**: The bot's display logic didn't properly handle all book states and provide clear status information to users.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Book Status Retrieval (`book_manager.py`)

**Problem**: Cache failures caused empty status results
**Solution**: Added direct Google Sheets fallback in `get_book_status()` and `get_book_info()` methods

```python
def get_book_status(self, book_id: str) -> str:
    # Try cache first
    if self.cache:
        cached_status = self.cache.get_book_status(book_id)
        if cached_status is not None:
            return cached_status
    
    # Fallback to Google Sheets - direct query
    try:
        from google_sheets_manager import GoogleSheetsManager
        sheets_manager = GoogleSheetsManager()
        df = sheets_manager.read_books()
        # ... query logic
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting book status for {book_id}: {e}")
        return ""
```

### 2. Improved Pending Books Logic (`book_manager.py`)

**Problem**: Only showed 'delivered' books, missing other booked books
**Solution**: Show all booked books regardless of delivery status

```python
def get_user_pending_pickup_books(self, user_id):
    # Get all user's booked books that haven't been picked up yet
    # Include all booked books, not just those with 'delivered' status
    # This way users can see all their booked books and their current status
```

### 3. Enhanced Display Logic (`bot.py`)

**Problem**: Poor user experience with unclear status information
**Solution**: Added comprehensive status display and summary information

```python
def _build_user_books_text(self, active_books, books_df):
    # Handle different book states
    if book['date_booked'] is None:
        # Book is booked but not picked up yet
        text += f"‚è≥ –°—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å: –ó–∞–±—Ä–æ–Ω—å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞\n"
        if book.get('status'):
            status_text = self._get_status_display_text(book['status'])
            text += f"üì¶ –î–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞: {status_text}\n"
    else:
        # Book has been picked up
        text += f"üóì –ó–∞–±—Ä–æ–Ω—å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ: {book['date_booked'].strftime('%d.%m.%Y')}\n"
        text += f"üìÖ –ü–æ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç–∏ –¥–æ: {book['expiry_date'].strftime('%d.%m.%Y')}\n"
```

### 4. Added Status Display Helper (`bot.py`)

**Problem**: Raw status values were not user-friendly
**Solution**: Added `_get_status_display_text()` method to convert status to readable text

```python
def _get_status_display_text(self, status):
    status_lower = str(status).lower()
    if status_lower == config.STATUS_VALUES['BOOKED']:
        return "–û—á—ñ–∫—É—î –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏"
    elif status_lower == config.STATUS_VALUES['DELIVERED']:
        return "–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –¥–æ –æ—Ç—Ä–∏–º–∞–Ω–Ω—è!"
    # ... etc
```

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Debugging

**Problem**: Difficult to debug issues
**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging and debug script

- Added detailed logging in `_handle_my_books()`
- Created `debug_books.py` script for testing
- Added summary information in book display

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Run the Debug Script
```bash
cd telegram-bot
python debug_books.py
```

Enter your user ID when prompted to test the functionality.

### 2. Test Different Book States
The system should now properly show:

- **Booked but not delivered**: Shows as "–ó–∞–±—Ä–æ–Ω—å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞" with "–û—á—ñ–∫—É—î –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏"
- **Delivered but not picked up**: Shows as "–ó–∞–±—Ä–æ–Ω—å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞" with "–ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –¥–æ –æ—Ç—Ä–∏–º–∞–Ω–Ω—è!"
- **Picked up and active**: Shows pickup date and days remaining
- **Overdue books**: Shows as "–ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—á–µ–Ω–æ"

### 3. Test Cache Failures
The system should continue working even if Redis cache is unavailable, falling back to Google Sheets.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Complete Book List**: Users see all their booked books regardless of delivery status
2. **Clear Status Information**: Each book shows its current status in user-friendly language
3. **Summary Information**: Users see a summary of their books (active, pending, ready for pickup)
4. **Robust Fallback**: System works even when cache is unavailable
5. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and logging for debugging

## Files Modified

1. `book_manager.py` - Enhanced status retrieval and pending books logic
2. `bot.py` - Improved display logic and user experience
3. `debug_books.py` - New debug script for testing
4. `ACTIVE_BOOKS_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Status Values Reference

- `booked` - Book is booked but not yet delivered
- `delivered` - Book is delivered and ready for pickup
- `returned` - Book is returned but waiting for admin confirmation
- `''` (empty) - Book is available for booking
